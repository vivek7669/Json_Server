Random module –  This module contains the functions which are used for generating random numbers. A. Random Function – It returns random float number(s) between 0 and 1. np.random.random((2,3))  # It creates a 2-D array of shape 2×3 with random values. B. Randint Function – It generates random integer number(s) between given range. – By default, the range starts from 0. – The numbers can repeat. np.random.randint(5,20,4)  # It create a 1-D array of given no. of integer values (4 here) between given input numbers 5 & 20.

A = np.empty( 4 ) ;; B = np.empty( (5,3) , dtype=int ) ;; C = np.empty( [2,5,3] , dtype=object ) Syntax : np.empty ( shape, dtype ) – Shape can given in list or tuple form – The default datatype is float 29. We can define the data types of rows & columns A = np.full( (2,3), 3, dtype = [ (‘x’,float) , (‘y’,int) ]) 30. Eye Function – np.eye() –  The Eye Function returns a 2-D array , with 1 on diagonal and 0 elsewhere. Syntax : np.eye(shape, k, dtype) – Here, if only No. of Rows is passed, then No. of Columns = No. of Rows – K is Index of diagonal, by default, k=0 means Main diagonal ; when k=positive means Upper diagonal ; when k=negative means Lower diagonal – The default datatype is float 31. Identity Array – np.identity() –  It returns an identity array i.e., a square array with 1 on the main diagonal and all other elements are 0. Syntax : np.identity(shape, dtype) – It takes a single integer value only as shape. – The No. of Rows and No. of Columns will be equal to the given integer value. – The default datatype is float 32. Ones Like Array –  It returns an array of Ones, with the same shape & type as of the given array. Syntax : np.ones_like(array, dtype) Ex : A = np.ones_like(B) – It will return an array A of Ones, of same shape & type as of the given already created array B. 33. Zeros Like Array –  It returns an array of Zeros, with the same shape & type as of the given array.

Full Like Array –  It returns a full array of Constant element, with the same shape & type as of the given array. Syntax : np.full_like(array, fill_value, dtype) Ex : X = np.full_like(Y, 7) – It will return an array X filled with constant value 7, of same shape & type as of the given already created array Y. 35. Diagonal Function  – It is used to extract the diagonal elements of an array, or , used to construct a new diagonal array. Syntax : np.diag(a, k) – If ‘a’ is a 2-D array, it extracts the diagonal elements. – If ‘a’ is a 1-D array, it constructs a 2-D array with elements of ‘a’ on diagonal. – By default, k is 0. Use k>0 for diagonals above the main diagonal. Use k<0 for diagonals below the main diagonal. 36. Transpose Function –  It converts the Rows into Columns, and Columns into Rows. Syntax : array.T , or , np.transpose(array) 37. copy() –  A = a.copy() # It returns a copy of the array. 38. Operators – +, – , * , / –  A = np.array([1,2,3]) ; B = A + 1 à B = [2,3,4] ; C = A * 2 à C = [2,4,6] 39. Transpose –  a.T # Coverts the rows into columns and columns into rows. 40. Unary Operators –  Those operators that require only one operand. Suppose ‘a’ is an array : a.max() , a.max(axis=1), a.max(axis=0) , a.sum() a.min() , a.min(axis=1) , a.min(axis=0) , np.sum(a, axis=1) # These functions can be applied row-wise or column-wise by setting an axis parameter. 41. stack –  c = np.stack( (a,b) ) # It creates a matrix using the arrays as rows. 42. column_stack –  c = np.column_stack( (a,b) ) # It creates a matrix using the arrays as columns. 43. V-Stack and H-Stack –  Vstack or Hstack is used to combine two or more arrays to form a new array. 43.A) vstack –  c = np.vstack( (a,b) ) # It appends the data vertically. a and b are arrays. 43.B) hstack –  c = np.hstack( (a,b) ) # It appends the data horizontally. a and b are arrays. 44. Array Indexing –  Indexing is used to obtain particular element(s) or row(s) or column(s) from the numpy array(s). Here, we pass the Index of the element to access it. The Index starts from 0, not from 1. It returns elements till “stop index – 1” index. Indexing in 1-D Array : Format – array[start index : stop index] Indexing in 2-D Array : Format – array[row_indexing, column_indexing] Indexing in 3-D Array : Format – array[matrix_indexing, row_indexing, column_indexing] Ex – a[1:2,1:2,1:2] # Since arrays may be multidimensional, we must specify a slice for each dimension of the array. 45. Mix-Integer Indexing –  a[1,1:2,1:2] # Mix integer indexing with Slice Indexing yields an array of lower rank. While, using only slices, it yields an array of same rank as the original array. 46. Integer Array Indexing –  a[[0,1,2],[0,1,0]] # It allows us to construct arbitrary (random choice) array using the data from another array. 47. Boolean Array Indexing –  a[a>2] # It is used to select the elements of an array that satisfy some condition. 48. .dot()  # It is used to compute inner product of the vectors, to multiply a vector by matrix, & to multiply matrixes. 49. np.any(x > 0.9)  # It checks if any value is greater than 0.9 in x. ( x = np.random.random(10)) 50. np.all(x >= 0.9)  # It checks if all values are greater than or equal to 0.1 in x. ( x = np.random.random(10)) 51. array_A[array_A == x] = y  # Replacing all x in the given array_A with y. 52. a[[2,4]] or a[(1,3),:]  # Getting the values from 2nd and 4th row of the matrix. 53. To get the results from the matrix :  a.sum(), a.std(), a.var(), a.mean(), a.max(), a.min()",

C++ can be found just about everywhere you look. It powers search engines, VR applications, air travel, movie production, and even exploration on Mars! In fact, C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages there is. What makes C++ unique? C++ is a general-purpose programming language, created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979. Over the decades, C++ has become the language of choice for certain kinds of applications. C++ is most popularly used for building large software infrastructure and applications that run on limited resources. Because C++ can directly manipulate the hardware (or machine) that it runs on, programmers can fine-tune their code to run efficiently in any environment, even when there’s limited hardware space or energy available to power the application. This translates to applications that run quickly and reliably on a variety of devices, making C++ ideal for forming the base layer of many important applications. For these reasons, C++ is an excellent choice for building software that is fast, efficient at managing system resources, and reliable in performing critical tasks. What is C++ used for? C++ can be found in a wide variety of industries. Check out the following list for some of the most notable, interesting, and even surprising real-world applications of C++. Operating systems C++ plays an important part in well-known operating systems, from MacOS and Windows to mobile operating systems like iOS. In general, operating systems need to be fast and efficient at managing system resources. With the low-level (close to machine code) capabilities of C++, developers can structure their code to make even the smallest details of an operating system fast and energy efficient. Game development C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages in game development. It has been used to create: games, such as World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, and StarCraft, game engines like Unreal Engine, and gaming consoles, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch. Gaming involves lots of resource-intensive functions, whether it’s generating graphics or facilitating multiplayer sessions. C++ helps in optimizing the use of resources, such as allowing programmers to adjust exactly how data structures and memory allocation are handled. IoT devices IoT (Internet of Things) devices include embedded systems that often rely on C++. Some examples of these devices are appliances, cars, smartwatches, TVs, and medical devices. Because the hardware is often embedded inside of an object, these devices have to operate with limited computing resources and strict power requirements. C++ helps programmers control how these resources are used in order to run programs more efficiently. Databases C++ is used to build popular database tools like MySQL and MongoDB. These databases form the backbone of many well-known applications, including ones created by Google, Netflix, YouTube, Adobe, and more. C++ is ideal for helping structure databases to support efficient storage. Web browsers C++ plays a role in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera. It is used to develop back-end services that retrieve information from databases and render code into interactive web pages. C++ helps web browsers carry out these tasks with speed and minimal delays, which means we don’t have to wait long for content to appear on our screens. Machine learning tools Machine learning tools, such as TensorFlow, rely on C++ as a back-end programming language. Even though data scientists can use TensorFlow with Python, for example, the core machine learning calculations are carried out with C++ code. In fact, C++ has a large collection of libraries that power these highly-sophisticated calculations that train machine learning models. AR/VR applications C++ is widely used for developing augmented reality and virtual reality applications. In fact, many of these applications run on Unreal Engine, which is built using C++. AR/VR applications need to handle large amounts of data that adjust continuously based on input from camera sensors and user interactions. C++ is ideal for helping process all of this data while creating seamless virtual experiences. Scientific research C++ plays a notable role in scientific research, from space exploration to high-energy particle physics. At CERN, scientists use C++ for analyzing data on subatomic particles that can help answer questions about how our universe originated. At NASA, C++ has been used to build autonomous driving systems that help the Mars Rovers navigate unknown terrain. Many parts of the International Space Station are built using C++ as well. Financial tools Many banks and financial institutions use C++ to build their software infrastructure, which powers applications for banking, trading, and financial modeling. The speed and reliable performance of C++ is ideal for processing millions of daily transactions, facilitating a high volume and frequency of trades, and creating data simulations for large portfolios. Flight software C++ is a commonly-used language for flight software that powers commercial airplanes and military and defense aircraft (such as the F-16 and F-35 planes). C++ is used to build a lot of the safety-critical software, which is required to follow strict coding standards to make sure that the wings, engines, and other critical parts work predictably during each flight. Google search engine Google’s search engine relies on C++ to make sure that search results show up quickly and with minimal response time. C++ also powers the machine learning and other complex algorithms that make sure we get the best possible results for our search. Google’s crawling and indexing infrastructure is also implemented in C++. Medical technology C++ can be found in a variety of medical applications, from MRI machines to lab testing equipment to systems that handle patient information. C++ is also used to model data and run data simulations for bioinformatics research, because many advanced algorithms written for the medical and biological sciences are implemented in C++. Telecommunications C++ is widely used in building telephone, Internet, and other telecommunications infrastructure. It’s ideal for managing resources to handle tons of simultaneous communication with speed and efficiency. Movie production Many of the graphics and special effects that you see in movies are created with C++. C++ is great for this role because it can handle large files with high-quality footage and run many of the advanced calculations that make the special effects possible.",
